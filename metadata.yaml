description: "The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders (commonly known\
  \ simply as Moll Flanders) is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published in 1722.\
  \ It purports to be the true account of the life of the eponymous Moll, detailing\
  \ her exploits from birth until old age.\nBy 1721, Defoe had become a recognised\
  \ novelist, with the success of Robinson Crusoe in 1719. His political work was\
  \ tapering off at this point, due to the fall of both Whig and Tory party leaders\
  \ with whom he had been associated; Robert Walpole was beginning his rise, and Defoe\
  \ was never fully at home with the Walpole group. Defoe's Whig views are nevertheless\
  \ evident in the story of Moll, and the novel's full title gives some insight into\
  \ this and the outline of the plot:\n\nThe Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous\
  \ Moll Flanders, &c. Who was Born in Newgate, and during a Life of continu'd Variety\
  \ for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times\
  \ a Wife (whereof once to her own Brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported\
  \ Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest, and died a Penitent. Written\
  \ from her own Memorandums.\n\nIt is usually assumed that the novel is written by\
  \ Daniel Defoe, as his name is commonly published as the author in modern printings\
  \ of the novel, however the original printing did not have an author, as it was\
  \ an apparent autobiography. The attribution of Moll Flanders to Defoe was made\
  \ by Francis Noble, a bookseller in 1770, after Defoe's death in 1731.\nThe novel\
  \ is based partially on the life of Moll King, a London criminal whom Defoe met\
  \ while visiting Newgate Prison.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
